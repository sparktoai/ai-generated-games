- 🌍 **Multi-language Support**: Available in both English and Chinese versions
- ⏱️ **Real-time Timer**: Accurately records completion time
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation**: Provides intelligent assessment based on completion time and difficulty
- 📈 **History Tracking**: Automatically saves the last 10 training records
- 🎨 **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various device screens
- 💾 **Local Storage**: Uses browser localStorage to save data
- ✅ **Instant Feedback**: Visual feedback for correct and incorrect actions

## Training Principle

The Schulte grid is a commonly used method in psychology to study and develop attention. During training, neurons must quickly scan and identify target numbers while suppressing interference from other numbers. Long-term consistent training can:

- Improve visual attention
- Enhance concentration
- Accelerate information processing speed
- Improve visual search ability
