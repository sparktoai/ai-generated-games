## Project Overview

The Schulte Table Training Game is a web-based attention training tool designed to help users improve focus, visual search ability, and cognitive processing speed. It uses the classic Schulte grid training method to exercise the brain by sequentially finding and clicking randomly arranged numbers.

We've also added the classic 2048 puzzle game, a number merging game that challenges players to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

## Training Principle (Schulte Table)

The Schulte grid is a commonly used method in psychology to study and develop attention. During training, neurons must quickly scan and identify target numbers while suppressing interference from other numbers. Long-term consistent training can:

- Improve visual attention
- Enhance concentration
- Accelerate information processing speed
- Improve visual search ability
